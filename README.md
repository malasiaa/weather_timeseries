# Weather Time Series Forecasting

This repository contains various deep learning approaches for weather time series forecasting. The project focuses on predicting temperature changes based on historical data from the [Jena Climate Dataset (2009-2016)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mnassrib/jena-climate/code).

The notebook covers data preparation, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and the application of several neural network architectures including Dense Neural Networks (DNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM).

A forecast was made using 200 time steps. This graph illustrates the discrepancy between the forecasted outcomes and the true values.
